                    <h5>Some time around 35,000 years ago, when much of Europe was locked up in sheets of ice, an artist acquired a bit of mammoth ivory and began carving.
                         A masterpiece emerged in the form of a two-inch-long horse.
                          Its magnificently arched stallion's neck combines muscular potency and natural grace.
                           Its head, slightly cocked, gives the animal an air of deep contemplation.
